<h2>About</h2>

<body>
	<p>
	This site aims to serve as a hub for the scholarly and academic study of anarchism in Ukraine,
	highlighting the history of the movement from its origins in the 19th-century through its expression in the
    Makhnovist movement of the early 20th-century. Resources curated here were selected for their scholarly value and 
    contributions to the understanding of this history. The materials highlighted from the
    <a href="https://www.lib.utexas.edu/">UT Austin Libraries</a> distinctive collections were
    also selected due to their being rare or unique to North American librariesâ€™ holdings, making
    them of potential interest to researchers interested in examining hard-to-find-materials.
